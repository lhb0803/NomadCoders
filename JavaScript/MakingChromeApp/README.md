# 3 Javascript on Browser
## 3.0 The Document Object
* A browser has a **document** object
* We can call HTML tag from JS environment through an access to document object
* We can change HTML data by changing document object's properties

* Change things from document

## 3.2 Searching for Elements
* `getElementsByClassName()`, `getElementsByTagName()`
* `querySelector()`, `querySelectorAll()`: can access through CSS notation (much better way)
